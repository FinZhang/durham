## What is a living lab?

An ecosystem for studying real-life environments with iterative feeback processes through a lifecycle approach to innovate and improve ecosystem performance

## What will ICHS do?

IHCS has two major components

 - An immersion cooling tank for high performance computing made available to the community as a testbed to grow expertise with this technology
 - A feasibility study into the use of disused mine workings for seasonal storage of waste heat from data centres, allowing heat reuse for space heating during colder months
