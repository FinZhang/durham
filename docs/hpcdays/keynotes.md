### Abstract

### Short bio

Cristin Merritt serves as Chief Marketing Officer (CMO) for Alces Flight.  With over 20 years of experience in enterprise technology, and over 7 in HPC, Cristin’s skills are focused on understanding technology market trends, specifically in finding the intersection between hardware, software, and people, in order to bring about successful supercomputing solutions. At Alces Flight, Cristin has served within the partners and program teams, successfully launching complex integration projects, of which three have so far gone on to win global recognition for their accomplishments in multi-platform (hybrid) HPC.
Cristin graduated from the University of Florida with a degree in Classics and fell into tech while living in Houston, Texas.  She is a proud US/UK dual national, moving to Oxford, United Kingdom in 2008 where she currently resides with her husband, son, and far too many animals.

Title: Unleash the control freak in yourself for fun and profit - and for science!

### Abstract

Performance measurements and benchmarks are comparable to
experiments in laboratories where as much external influences as
possible have to be controlled and documented. In the recent years,
more and more conferences and journals request artifact descriptions
along with the paper to improve the reproducibility of research.
With the rising complexity of nowadays systems, the amount of
influences increases dramatically and the various settings are often
unknown to the researchers. While information like operating system,
software versions and CPU/GPU types are often documented in papers,
information like system temperatures, MPI runtime settings and
device power limits are not mentioned despite their influence on
performance.

MachineState provides a systematic approach to gather as many
performance influencing factors as known to the performance
engineering community. It records hardware details as well as
information about the runtime environment and the application in a
single shareable JSON file. It is a valuable source of information
when recapping previously done measurement runs. MachineState can
compare the current state with a previously created file to guide
the configuration of a system and the runtime environment for
reproducibility research. The feature can also be used to spot
differences when comparing two similar systems showing divergent
runtime behavior. But most importantly, it provides a simple-to-use
method for all researchers to provide good artifact description for
the reproducibility and therefore underlines the quality of their
research. 

### Short bio

During his apprenticeship at the Erlangen Regional Computing Center (RRZE), the IT service provider for the Friedrich-Alexander-Universität Erlangen-Nürnberg (FAU), Thomas Gruber collected experience with all kinds of clustering approaches. Afterwards, he studied Computer Science at RWTH Aachen University with emphasis on parallel programming and operating system kernel development. At the same time, he worked as a research assistant for the HPC group of the RWTH IT center. After receiving his M. Sc. degree, he went back to RRZE to work for the HPC group. Since 2021, he works in the Software & Tools division at Erlangen National High Performance Computing Center (NHR@FAU). Thomas Gruber leads the development of the performance tool suite LIKWID, which comprises easy-to-use tools for hardware performance monitoring, affinity control and micro-benchmarking. He also works on projects involving monitoring and analysis of hardware performance data. He is actively involved in tutorials and lectures about performance analysis and optimization, where he presents the LIKWID tools and leads hands-on exercises.
