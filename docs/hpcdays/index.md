2nd June - 7th June 2025

Following successful events in 2023 and 2024, we are happy to announce the 2025 Durham HPC Days in the week predating the ISC Conference in Hamburg. Our 2025 theme focuses on the fact that there is, despite people claiming different things, no gap between HPC and AI: HPC underpins progress in both simulations - high-performance and high throughput - and AI. We are all in the same boat. However, different communities have different needs how the HPC infrastructure is used and provided, and they also affect each other. Following this "difference but common interests", we will attempt to bring disciplines to Durham which had been underrepresented in previous years.

## Supporters

If you would like to sponsor the event, please contact us!

## Call for presentations

As in previous years, we want to encourage the community to submit proposals for presentations. Presentations are expected to run 20 minutes in total (roughly 15+5). We will fill slots in waves as we see fit, i.e. there’s no specific deadline. The earlier people submit a title with a brief abstract (256 words max) the higher the probability that we will be able to accommodate you. Besides the general call for presentations, we will run workshops on bespoke themes.

 

At least one person per submissions is expected to register and participate in-person at the event.

Link coming soon

## Registration


Registration will open early 2025. We will charge a 50 GBP fee per person.

Link coming soon.

## Travel in and around Durham and accommodation

There is no financial or logistics support for accommodation and travel.

There are plenty of [hotels](hotels.md) in Durham.  Participants will need to make all bookings themselves.




The University’s official [Visit Us](https://www.durham.ac.uk/visit-us/) page provides some general guidance how to find us. The Department of Computer Science is on Mount Joy next to the Botanic Garden. Here are some further remarks how to get there:


- If you are arriving at Newcastle International, take the tram (there’s only one) to Newcastle Central (less than 40 minute) and then take a train to the South. Durham is 15 minutes away from Newcastle Central.
- Alternatively, you can take a taxi from the airport (should be around 60 GBP for a drive of around 40 minutes in total). You can book a taxi directly within the airport at the counter next to the International Arrivals.
- From Durham train station, it is a 30-40 minute walk, which is quite beautiful.
- Taxis should be available from the station and should be around 10-15 GBP.
- Right in front of the station, there’s a bus stop with two lines:
  - Bus 42 to Mount Oswald. It runs every 30 minutes. Get off at “South Road Colleges” and walk up the hill from there (5 minutes).
  - Bus 41 to University Science Park. Hop off at the final stop.

## Arriving by plane and travel to ISC

 

Many of our guests and friends will travel to ISC afterwards. Newcastle is the nearest airport and there are regular connections from Heathrow (BA), Frankfurt (Lufthansa) and Amsterdam (KLM). LNER has a fast, frequent connection (3hrs) to London Kings Cross, next to the EuroStar. Please note that ISC starts one day later this year due to a public bank holiday in Germany.
