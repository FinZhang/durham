</center>



We will offer two variants of this trip: A short one (approx 5.5km) and a longer one (approx 17km).
The shortest variant is will provide the opportunity to have a drop-off at Newcastle Airport.
Hadrian's Wall is free of charge to walk. 
Participants might want to visit <a href="https://www.english-heritage.org.uk/visit/places/housesteads-roman-fort-hadrians-wall/">Housesteads Roman Fort</a> or have meals in one of the pubs along the way on their own expenses.

## Agenda

- 8:00 Meet at Department of Computer Science; participants can leave their luggage in the bus
- 10:00 Arrival at Housestead's Romand Fort
- 12:30 Pick up at The Sill National Landscape Discovery centre (next to Once Brewed Pub); drop off at Newcastle Airport around 13:30 (there is also a metro connection to Newcastle Central Station) - maybe drop back in Durham?
- 16:00 Pick up at the Greenhead Hotel, Bar & Restaurant
- 17:30 Drop off at Durham Station or Computer Science building

We will collect preferred variants of participants upon departure, but it is the participants' own responsibility to arrive at the pick up points on time.


## Insurance and risk

Hiking is a risky activity. 
Participants join the trip on their own risk, i.e. the organiser is not liable.
We will collect emergency contact information and any medical information to pass on to paramedics upon departure.


## Further participants

We might have the opportunity to fill empty spaces on the bus with spouses and friends. Please contact the organisers ahead of time.
