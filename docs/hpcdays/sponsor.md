# Sponsor and Supporter information

If you are sponsoring and supporting HPC Days 2025, THANK YOU VERY MUCH!  We would not be able to run the event without you!

This page will hopefully include the information that you need to make a success of the event, but if there is information missing please contact us.

## Attendance and registration

You are welcome to attend as little or as much of the event as you wish.  Please [register here](https://pay.durham.ac.uk/event-durham/durham-hpc-days-2025) so that we know roughly when to expect you, and can cater for you!

The key day to attend is the Wednesday afternoon/evening when the sponsor session will be.  We expect that most sponsors will arrive on Wednesday and depart on Thursday.  However, some will likely stay for the full week, which is very welcome.

Durham has plenty of [hotels](hotels.md) to chose from.

## Sponsor session

On Wednesday afternoon, there will be a Sponsor's session starting at 16:30, with lightning talks followed by a panel session where the audience can ask you questions.

Please plan a talk of around 5 minutes for this.  You can either present using your own laptop, or provide the slides to us in advance.  The talk should be aimed at a research audience (non-technical, with some technical ability), and should not be a marketing talk, since the audience will likely have no direct purchasing power.

## Table top display

You will have a table top where you can set up a stand.  Feel free to bring a banner, and stuff to go on your table, including merch to give away.  This will be adjacent to the coffee/lunch room, so should see good footfall.

## Treasure hunt

There will be a treasure hunt for attendees (including sponsors, if desired) to do, which will encourage interaction with the sponsors.  They will need to ask you a question or get information from your stand to complete the answers, and so help to encourage interaction.
