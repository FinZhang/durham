### DiRAC RSEs: 13:30-15:00 and 15:30-17:00

**Convener: Ilektra Christidi (UCL)**

This session is for the DiRAC RSEs to present their work to the UK HPC community, as well as catch up with each other and other DiRAC people that might want to join. Come join us to see how DiRAC RSEs accelerate science in particle physics, astrophysics, and cosmology, by promoting good software development practices, optimising software running on the DiRAC sites, and assisting researchers in implementing new functionality and using accelerators in their codes.

- 13:30-15:00: 4x20-minute talks (speakers to be confirmed)
- 15:30-17:00: This workshop consists of two parts, and the second part is for DiRAC RSEs only.

### Benchmarking Symposium: Benchmarking of HPC systems for simulation and AI 9:45-12:00

** Conveners: DiRAC, ExCALIBUR, UKRI Living Benchmarks
** Lead: Mark Wilkinson 

Benchmarking is an essential part of the co-design and procurement of large-scale computing
systems, supporting the deployment of cost-e8ective, productive services. Benchmarks are
also valuable tools for obtaining quantitative information about the health of systems following
their deployment in production, for example confirming that application performance is
maintained following system software updates.

The UK has an outstanding track record of the successful use of science benchmarks to
optimise the design of large-scale computing services. There are a number of recent and
currently active projects in this area, including the ExCALIBUR Benchmarking project, the
ExCALIBUR BASE-II project, the UKRI Living Benchmarks project and the DiRAC-4 design
process. As UKRI develops its plans for the services which will comprise the future DRI
ecosystem, a workshop to discuss the benefits and challenges of e8ective benchmarking is
particularly timely.

The goals of this workshop are to:

1. share experiences (both positive and negative) and tools related to the development and
application of benchmark codes in system co-design, procurement or health-checking.
2. support the development and sharing of best practice in the area of benchmarking
   
We will invite speakers from across the benchmarking activities mentioned above and will also
actively seek presentations from other individuals and groups with relevant experience either
in the UK or internationally. We will also try to include at least one presentation by an
international partner to bring insights from outside the UK.

### HPC in Weather & Climate Research: 13:30-15:00 and 15:30-17:00

**Conveners: Chris Maynard (Met Office), Marion Weinzierl (ICCS, University of Cambridge)**

More details coming soon! 

## Thursday, 5 June 2025: 9:45-12:00

### eCSE Session

**Convener: Mladen Ivkovich (Durham University)**

The ARCHER2 GPU eCSE support provides funding to the UKRI research community to develop software in a sustainable manner to run on GPU-based architectures. Two such GPU eCSE calls have closed recently. In this knowledge exchange workshop, leads and developers of the funded projects present their current work and the challenges they're facing in their respective domains with regards to HPC GPU acceleration of scientific software. 


### WHPC: 13:30-15:00 and 15:30-17:00

**Convener: Eleanor Broadway (EPCC)**

Organised by representatives from the Women in High Performance Computing (WHPC) community, this session will explore new, sustainable and realistic strategies for improving and supporting the diversity in our community. Donâ€™t miss this opportunity to be part of the conversation on overcoming our current barriers to change, exploring the crucial role of funders and leaders, and discovering how we can all contribute to a more inclusive future in HPC and beyond.

More details coming soon!
