### DiRAC RSEs: 13:30-15:00 and 15:30-17:00

This session is for the DiRAC RSEs to present their work to the UK HPC community, as well as catch up with each other and other DiRAC people that might want to join. Come join us to see how DiRAC RSEs accelerate science in particle physics, astrophysics, and cosmology, by promoting good software development practices, optimising software running on the DiRAC sites, and assisting researchers in implementing new functionality and using accelerators in their codes.

13:30-15:00: 4x20-minute talks (speakers to be confirmed)
15:30-17:00: This workshop consists of two parts, and the second part is for DiRAC RSEs only.
