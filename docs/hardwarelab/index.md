# Durham HPC Hardware Lab

The Durham HPC Hardware Lab provides Durham and UK researchers with access to cutting edge technologies and facilities.
It is hosted by the [COSMA HPC facility](https://cosma.readthedocs.io) (although you don't need to be a COSMA user to run on the hardware lab) and receives funding from Durham University, industry partners, UKRI (e.g. through ExCALIBUR) and DiRAC.

## Access

Access to the testbed installations is presented [on a dedicated access page](access.md).

## How to contribute

We appreciate help of colleagues to keep our pages up-to-date and consistent, and to add any missing information. The update of the pages is presented [on a dedicated "how to contribute" page](contribute.md).

## Further information

A lot of information about the Durham HPC Hardware Lab is still hosted by the [COSMA HPC documentation](https://cosma.readthedocs.io) although we are in the process of moving relevant information over to this site.


A list of [historical hardware](historic.md) (now retired) is maintained.
