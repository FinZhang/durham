# Durham HPC Hardware Lab

The Durham HPC Hardware Lab is hosted by the [COSMA HPC facility](https://cosma.readthedocs.io) and provides Durham and UK researchers with access to cutting edge technologies and facilities.

These include:

- [DINE:](https://cosma.readthedocs.io/en/latest/dine.html) A test cluster with BlueField-2 DPUs
- [DINE2:](https://cosma.readthedocs.io/en/latest/dine.html#dine2) A test cluster with a composable fabric and NVIDIA Ampere GPUs
- [GPU compute](https://cosma.readthedocs.io/en/latest/hardwarelab.html#gpu-compute)
  - NVIDIA A100, A30, H100
  - NVIDIA Grace Hopper
  - AMD MI100, MI210
  - Intel Ponte Vecchio
- [Composable infrastructure](https://cosma.readthedocs.io/en/latest/composable.html)
- [Rockport 6D Torus fabric](https://cosma.readthedocs.io/en/latest/rockportlab.html)
- [Storage laboratory](https://cosma.readthedocs.io/en/latest/storagelab.html)
- [Solar panel installation](https://cosma.readthedocs.io/en/latest/environmental.html#solar-panels)
