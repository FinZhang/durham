# Durham HPC Hardware Lab

The Durham HPC Hardware Lab provides Durham and UK researchers with access to cutting edge technologies and facilities.

## Testbed

These include:

- [DINE:](https://cosma.readthedocs.io/en/latest/dine.html) A test cluster with BlueField-2 DPUs
- [DINE2:](https://cosma.readthedocs.io/en/latest/dine.html#dine2) A test cluster with a composable fabric and NVIDIA Ampere GPUs
- [GPU compute](https://cosma.readthedocs.io/en/latest/hardwarelab.html#gpu-compute)
  - NVIDIA A100, A30, H100
  - NVIDIA Grace Hopper
  - AMD MI100, MI210
  - Intel Ponte Vecchio
- [Composable infrastructure](https://cosma.readthedocs.io/en/latest/composable.html)

## Access

## Further information

A lot of information about the Durham HPC Hardware Lab is still hosted by the [COSMA HPC documentation](https://cosma.readthedocs.io) although we are in the process of moving relevant information over to this site.
